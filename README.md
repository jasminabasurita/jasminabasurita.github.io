# Hi, I'm Jazzy!

Five years ago I fell in love with Arch Linux and started hacking mine and my friends computers. I rapidly fell down a rabbit hole of config files, documentation, and what seemed like an endless cycle of breaking and fixing my build (thankfully it ended!).

For years I listened to the impostor syndrome in my head and sought out a passion for the culinary arts instead of computers. Then, one year ago, that all changed. An NPR segment about the evolution of the tech industry finally flipped a switch and I knew that the only way to pursue my goals were to start incorporating the emerging technologies into everything I did. I got home and immediately kicked into research mode, started studying Ruby, discovered Grace Hopper and knew that I wouldn’t stop until I was a developer.

Now, as a software engineer, I look to implement my skills in solving real world problems whenever I can. I strongly believe in the advancements that programming can offer in the way that we learn and grow as people. When I’m not programming I love hiking, kayaking, snowshoeing, gardening, playing accordion, and playing with my three dogs.
